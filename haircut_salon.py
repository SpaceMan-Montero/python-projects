# Carly's Clippers
# You are the Data Analyst at Carlyâ€™s Clippers, the newest hair salon on the
# block. Your job is to go through the lists of data that have been collected
# in the past couple of weeks. You will be calculating some important metrics
# that Carly can use to plan out the operation of the business for the rest of
# the month.

# Create list of hairstyles

              "crew", "bowl", "bob", "mohawk", "flattop"]

# Create list of prices (corresponding to each respective hairstyles)
prices = [30, 25, 40, 20, 20, 35, 50, 35]

# Create list of number of times a haircut was purchased
# (corresponding to each respective hairstyles)

# Calculate total price of all haircuts
total_price = 0
for price in prices:
    total_price += price

# Calculate average price of haircuts
average_price = total_price/len(prices)
print("Average Haircut Price:", average_price)

# Adjust prices by reducing $5 from each
new_prices = [price - 5 for price in prices]

print("Total Revenue: ", total_revenue)

average_daily_revenue = total_revenue/7

# Determine haircuts under $30 after price reduction
